=head1 NAME

UserAgent::Any â€“ Wrapper above any UserAgent library, supporting sync and async
calls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $ua = UserAgent::Any->new(LWP::UserAgent->new(%options));

  my $res = $ua->get($url, %params);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<UserAgent::Any> is to user agents what L<Log::Any> is to loggers, it allows to
write libraries making RPC calls without having to rely on one particular user
agent implementation.

C<UserAgent::Any> also supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls even if
the underlying user agent is synchronous only.

=head2 Constructor

  my $ua = UserAgent::Any->new($underlying_ua);

Builds a new C<UserAgent::Any> object wrapping the given underlying user agent.
Currently supported wrapped objects are L<LWP::UserAgent>,
L<AnyEvent::UserAgent> and L<Mojo::UserAgent>. Feel free to ask for or
contribute new implementations.
