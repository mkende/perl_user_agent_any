=head1 NAME

UserAgent::Any â€“ Wrapper above any UserAgent library, supporting sync and async
calls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $ua = UserAgent::Any->new(LWP::UserAgent->new(%options));

  my $res = $ua->get($url, %params);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<UserAgent::Any> is to user agents what L<Log::Any> is to loggers, it allows to
write libraries making RPC calls without having to rely on one particular user
agent implementation.

C<UserAgent::Any> also supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls even if
the underlying user agent is synchronous only.

=head2 Supported user agents

=head3 L<LWP::UserAgent>

When using an L<LWP::UserAgent>, a C<UserAgent::Any> object only implements the
synchronous calls (without the C<_cb> or C<_p> suffixes).

=head3 L<Mojo::UserAgent>

When using a L<Mojo::UserAgent>, a C<UserAgent::Any> object implements the
asynchronous calls using the global singleton L<Mojo::IOLoop> and returns
L<Mojo::Promise> objects for the method with the C<_p> suffix.

=head3 L<AnyEvent::UserAgent>



=head2 Constructor

  my $ua = UserAgent::Any->new($underlying_ua);

Builds a new C<UserAgent::Any> object wrapping the given underlying user agent.
The wrapped object must be an instance of a
L<supported user agent|/Supported user agent>. Feel free to ask for or
contribute new implementations.

=head2 Methods

=head3 get

  my $res = $ua->get($url, %params);

  $ua->get_cb($url, %params)->($cb);

  my $promise = $ua->get_p($url, %params);

=head3 post

  my $res = $ua->post($url, %params, $content);

  $ua->post_cb($url, %params, $content)->($cb);

  my $promise = $ua->post_p($url, %params, $content);

=head3 Where are the other methods?

Modern REST application should only use the C<GET> and C<POST> verbs so these
are the only one implemented currently. If you need them, feel free to ask for
or contribute the implementation of other methods.
