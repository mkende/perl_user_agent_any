      $res->header(Foo => 'bar');
      $res->header(Baz => [qw(abc def)]);
    }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the synopsis for now.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

There is no handling of the content encoding and content charset in this fake
object. So you should always just fill the C<content> directly and not rely on
C<raw_content>.

=item *

The headers returned by C<headers()> are sorted by names (and the order of their
values is preserved from the input). This is to help write deterministic tests
but this is B<not> the behavior of the real implementations.
