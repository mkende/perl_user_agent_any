=head1 NAME

UserAgent::Any::Wrapper – Helpers to write higher level client libraries on top
of C<UserAgent::Any>, while retaining its benefit (support of any user agent,
all HTTP verbs, multiple asynchronous models, etc.).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  wrap_method('bar' => 'foo', sub ($self, @args) { make_args_for_foo($@args) });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This section describes how to write higher level client libraries, on top of
C<UserAgent::Any>, while retaining its benefit (support for any user agents and
multiple asynchronous models).

You should first read the documentation of the
L<C<UserAgent::Any::get()> method>|UserAgent::Any/get> to understand the
asynchronous models implemented by L<UserAgent::Any>.

=head3 Wrapping a class method

  wrap_method($name => $delegate, sub ($self, ...) { ... }, sub ($self, $res, ...));

The call above will generate in your class a set of methods named C<$name>,
C<$name_cb>, and C<$name_p>. These methods will each execute the first sub that
was passed to C<wrap_method()> and then pass the results to the method named
with C<$delegate> and a suffix matching that of the function called. The result
of that call if passed to the second sub, if it was provided, in the right async
context (in a callback or a C<then> method of a promise).

For example, if you have a class that can I<already> handle methods C<foo>,
C<foo_cb>, and C<foo_p> with the same semantics as the user agent methods above
(this will typically be the methods for C<UserAgent::Any> itself) and you want
to expose a method C<bar> that depends on C<foo> you can write:

  wrap_method('bar' => 'foo', sub ($self, @args) { make_args_for_foo($@args) });

And this will expose in your package a set of C<bar>, C<bar_cb>, and C<bar_p>
methods with the same semantics that will use the provided method reference to
build the arguments to C<foo>. For the synchronous case, the method from the
example above will be equivalent to:

  sub bar ($self, @args) { $self->foo($self, make_args_for_foo(@args))}

You can optionally pass a second callback that will be called with the response
from the wrapped method:

  wrap_method($name => $delegate, $cb,
              sub ($self, $res, @args) { process_results($res) });

The second callback will be called with the current object, the response from
the wrapped method and the arguments that were passed to the wrappers (the same
that were already passed to the first callback). The wrapped method will be
called in list context. If it returns exactly 1 result, then that result is
passed as-is to the second callback; if it returns 0 result, then the callback
will receive C<undef>; otherwise the callback will receive an array reference
with the result of the call.

The call above is equivalent to the following code (for the synchronous case):

  sub bar ($self, @args) {
    process_results($self->foo($self, make_args_for_foo(@args)));
  }

If you don’t pass a second callback, then the callback, promise or method will
return the default result from the invoked method, without any transformation.

=head3 Wrapping a method of a class member

  wrap_method($name => \&getter, $delegate, $cb1[, $cb2]);

Alternatively to the above, C<wrap_method> can be used to wrap a method of a
class member. Instead of calling the method named C<$delegate> in your class,
the call above will call the method named C<$delegate> on the reference returned
by the call to C<&getter> (that must be a class method).

=head3 Wrapping all the UserAgent::Any methods

  wrap_all_methods(\&getter, $cb1[, $cb2]);

This call will generates in your package all the methods exposed by
L<UserAgent::Any> (get(), post(), etc. and their asynchronous variants) by
wrapping the similarly named methods of the object returned by C<getter()>.

The two callbacks C<$cb1> and C<$cb2> are used in the same way as described
above for all the calls.

Alternatively, you can use the following call:

  wrap_all_methods($package, $cb1[, $cb2]);

That one will also generate the same set of methods wrapping methods of the
object itself coming from a base class given by C<$package> (so
C<${package}::get>, C<${package}::post_cb>, etc.). The package will typically
name a base class of your class.

In addition, there are two other functions C<wrap_post_like_methods()> and
C<wrap_get_like_methods()> with the same signature (also accepting a getter or
a package name) which will generate a subset of all the user agent methods,
respectively for the methods that not expecting a request body (like C<GET>) and
for those that are expecting a request body (like C<POST>), in case you need to
use different callbacks for these two scenarios.

=head2 Example

Here is are two minimal example on how to create a client library for a
hypothetical service exposing a C<create> call using the C<POST> method.

  package MyPackage;

  use 5.036;

  use Moo;
  use UserAgent::Any 'wrap_method';

  use namespace::clean;

  extends 'UserAgent::Any';

  wrap_method(create_document => 'post', sub ($self, %opts) {
    return ('https://example.com/create/'.$opts{document_id}, $opts{content});
  });

Or, if you don’t want to re-expose the C<UserAgent::Any> method in your class
directly (possibly because you want to re-use the same names), you can do:

  package MyPackage;

  use 5.036;

  use Moo;
  use UserAgent::Any 'wrap_method';

  use namespace::clean;

  has ua => (
    is => 'ro',
    coerce => sub { UserAgent::Any->new($_[0]) },
    required => 1,
  );

  wrap_method(create_document => \&ua => 'post', sub ($self, %opts) {
    return ('https://example.com/create/'.$opts{document_id}, $opts{content});
  });
